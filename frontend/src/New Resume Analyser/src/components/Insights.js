        <h2>Resume Structure & Formatting</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Keep it concise:</strong> Limit your resume to 1-2 pages. Recruiters spend an average of just 6-7 seconds scanning each resume.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use a clean, professional design:</strong> Choose a simple, readable font and maintain consistent formatting throughout.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Include white space:</strong> Don't overcrowd your resume. Proper spacing improves readability and visual appeal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use bullet points:</strong> Present your achievements and responsibilities in easy-to-scan bullet points rather than paragraphs.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div className="insights-section">
        <h2>Content Optimization</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Tailor for ATS:</strong> Most companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to filter resumes. Include relevant keywords from the job description.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quantify achievements:</strong> Use numbers and percentages to demonstrate your impact (e.g., "Increased sales by 25%" rather than "Increased sales").
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Focus on achievements, not just duties:</strong> Highlight what you accomplished, not just what your responsibilities were.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use action verbs:</strong> Start bullet points with strong action verbs like "achieved," "implemented," "developed," etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <ul>
